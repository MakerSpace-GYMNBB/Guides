# Satellite Image Guide
## Description
The purpose of this guide is to teach how to receive images from weather satellites for example the NOAA15-20 satellites. The guide is meant for use in education for example geography class. It will teach you how to find a satellite, get the coressponding raw data from it and decode this data into an actual image. This guide will use for accessebility a WebSDR, but the same could also be achieved by using a physical SDR you own, like the HackRF One or the RTL-SDR.

## Requirements
PC with Windows / MacOS / Linux
Internet connection to get the raw audio data from the satellite using a WebSDR.

## Basic structure
1. We will use the website www.n2yo.com to get the position of the satellite.
2. The satellite encodes the pictures in audio and sends it over a specific frequency. This audio can later be decoded into an image. To recive the audio we will use a WebSDR in our case from Nürnberg, Germany.
3. To decode the raw audio data into an image, we will use a software called noaa-apt.


## Prework
To decode the audio data we will later receive, we will use a software called noaa-apt, you can find the install instructions on the website (https://noaa-apt.mbernardi.com.ar/download.html). As of now, there are only precompiled binaries available for windows, so you may be required to compile the software yourself
